## Docker

We provide a Docker configuration for your convenience. Begin by installing Docker on your system. You can run the tool as:

```
# docker build -t lyap .
# docker run -it lyap bash
```

You are now inside the container. `/project` contains all these files and Ubuntu has all the requirements pre-installed.
